The simple shell project is done by Joshua Bediako alone





Here are some important notes to consider when writing a simple shell in C:

User Input:

Use functions like fgets() to read user input from the command line.
Parse the input to separate the command and its arguments.
Forking and Executing:

Use fork() to create a new process for executing the command.
In the child process, use execvp() to replace the child process image with the specified command.
Handling Built-in Commands:

Implement built-in commands (e.g., cd, exit) separately using conditionals.
For built-in commands, execute them directly in the main process instead of forking.
Wait for Child Processes:

Use waitpid() or wait() to wait for child processes to finish execution.
This ensures that the shell does not proceed before the executed command completes.
Background Processes:

Allow commands to run in the background by appending & to the command.
Use the waitpid() function with the WNOHANG option to check if background processes have completed.
Signal Handling:

Implement signal handlers to catch and handle signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z).
Use the signal() or sigaction() function to set up signal handlers.
I/O Redirection:

Implement input (<) and output (>) redirection by modifying file descriptors using dup2() before executing commands.
Piping:

Implement piping (|) by creating a pipe using pipe() and using dup2() to redirect the input and output of commands.
Memory Management:

Properly manage memory to avoid memory leaks. Allocate memory dynamically and free it when it's no longer needed.
Error Handling:

Check the return values of system calls and functions for errors.
Print meaningful error messages to help diagnose issues.
Shell Prompt:

Display a prompt to indicate that the shell is ready to accept user input.
You can customize the prompt to show relevant information.
Interactive vs. Batch Mode:

Consider whether your shell will run interactively (user provides input) or in batch mode (commands from a file).
Security:

Be cautious about executing arbitrary commands, especially when running the shell with elevated privileges.
Testing and Debugging:

Test your shell with various commands, arguments, and scenarios to ensure its correctness.
Use debugging tools like printf statements or a debugger to identify and fix issues.
Documentation:

Document your code to explain its functionality, usage, and any design decisions you've made.
Creating a simple shell is a great way to understand process management, system calls, and basic command-line interactions in C. Keep in mind that while a simple shell provides a foundation, more advanced shells like Bash offer many additional features and complexities.
